# Challenge Dustin (Nginx)
## Requirements
* Terraform v1 or latest
* Ansible 2.9  or latest

## Introduction
* This automation is to the creation and deployment of a ngix web server on AWS environment with health checks to as the server is up and running.
* Here we are using IaC tools, Terraform and Ansible to achieve our target.


## Why do we need both Terraform and Ansible?
* Terraform is designed to provision different infrastructure components.
* Ansible is a configuration-management and application-deployment tool. 
* It means that youâ€™ll use Terraform first to create AWS resources and then use Ansible to install and set up the application on vm instance.

* [TerraformAnsible](https://www.hashicorp.com/resources/ansible-terraform-better-together) - Good page and video explaining why Ansible and HashiCorp are  better together.


## Terraform
#### To deploy the AWS resources
* VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
* Public & Private Subnets
* Internet Gatway
* NAT Gateway
* Route Table
* Security Groups (publicSG, lb_sg, efs_sg, private_sg)
* jumpserver
* AutoScaling Group
* LaunchConfiguration
* Aplication Load Balancer
* Elastic FileSystem

##### As a good practice, keep your terraform.tfstate file in a backend - [TerraformBackend](https://www.terraform.io/language/settings/backends)

## Ansible
#### To install the applications, packages and apply the following settings:
*  Install & Configure the nginx web application


## Setup
#### To run this project, perform the command lines:

```
# Clone the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/cz75ww/ChallengeDustin.git

# Choose the environment you wanna to apply ( staging or production )
$ cd envs/staging/

# Download the AWS modules and Plugs 
$ terraform init

# Rewrite Terraform configuration files to a canonical format and style
$ terraform fmt 

# Make sure if your syntax is correct
$ terraform validate

# See a preview and in case of no issue apply it
$ terraform plan -out challenge-dustin.plan
$ terraform apply challenge-dustin.plan

# To destroy the environment
$ terraform destroy --auto-approve
```
## Web health check script
#### The goal of this script is to check the health of server and webpage <br/>
     script name: ./scripts/health_check.sh

##### Requirements:
* Create AWS SNS topic in order to send the email with the notification. - [CreateSNSTopic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-create-topic.html)
* AWS Cli installed on job server that will be run the script. For example, linux cron job
* AWS profile configured
